# ResistorReader

This is a python program built for reader resistor color codes. I built it to be fitted onto a raspberry pi with GPIO buttons, so it can be kinda janky to use stand alone.

U am working on building a version specifically for running in terminal, and maybe even a version with GUI. However i am also working on other projects so dont hold your breath. But you are welcome to download and re-fit the code to work in whatever application you would like.
